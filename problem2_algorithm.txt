step1:
	As a Simulator start with Flipping a Coin to
	Display Heads or Tails by using random() function.
	Example:
		flipCoin=$((RANDOM%2))	
		H T
step2:
	As a simulator, loop through Multiple times of flipping a
	coin store the Singlet Combination in a Dictionary.
	Finally determine the percentage of the Singlet
	Combination
	Example:
	All head and tail combination: H T
	

step3:
	As a simulator, loop to create a Doublet Combination. Store the
	doublet combination as well as the percentage.		
	Example:
	All head and tail combination: HH HT TH TT
step4:
	As a simulator, loop to create a Triplet Combination. Store the
	Triplet combination as well as the percentage.
	All head and tail combination: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT

step5:
 	sort the Singlet, Doublet and Triplet combination and show the winning
        combination
